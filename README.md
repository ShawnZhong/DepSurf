Abstract
</summary>
eBPF programs significantly enhance kernel capabilities, but encounter substantial compatibility challenges due to their deep integration with unstable kernel internals. We introduce DepSurf, a tool that identifies dependency mismatches between eBPF programs and kernel images. Our analysis of 25 kernel images spanning 8 years reveals that dependency mismatches are pervasive, stemming from kernel source code evolution, diverse configuration options, and intricate compilation processes. We apply DepSurf to 53 real-world eBPF programs, and find that 83% are impacted by dependency mismatches, underscoring the urgent need for systematic dependency analysis. By identifying these mismatches, DepSurf enables a more robust development and maintenance process for eBPF programs, enhancing their reliability across a wide range of kernels.

## Prerequisites

DepSurf requires Python 3.11 or higher. Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 24.04.

We recommend using [uv](https://astral.sh/uv/) for environment setup: 

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Download the source code from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShawnZhong/DepSurf.git
cd DepSurf
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then, you can run the following commands to start Jupyter Lab:

```sh
uv run jupyter lab
```

## Result Reproduction

Please follow the instructions in the following Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the results in the paper.
